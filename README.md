# CODSOFT Internship Projects

The **CODSOFT** repository showcases the **three solo projects I created during my Java Programming internship at CodSoft**, where I applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts**. This internship provided hands-on experience in software development, focusing on problem-solving, real-world application development, and software best practices.

## 🔍 Internship Overview

During the internship, I worked on multiple tasks and independent projects that involved:

- Developing Java applications with core and advanced concepts
- Applying OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Implementing DSA concepts for efficient problem-solving
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and project management
- Debugging, testing, and optimizing code for better performance

## 🚀 Projects

1. **ATM Interface** – A console-based ATM simulation allowing users to perform basic banking operations like balance check, deposit, and withdrawal.  
2. **Guesser Game** – A number guessing game where the system generates a random number, and the user attempts to guess it within a limited number of attempts.  
3. **Student Grade Calculator** – A program that calculates and displays the total marks, average percentage, and grade based on user input for multiple subjects.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** – Core programming language for all projects  
- **OOP & DSA Concepts** – Applied across all projects for clean design and efficiency  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration  

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

Through this internship and the projects, I gained:

- Practical experience in designing and developing Java applications
- Strong understanding of OOP and DSA concepts in real-world scenarios
- Proficiency in debugging, testing, and optimizing Java programs
- Experience in using Git for version control and collaborative development

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

- Refactor projects for more modular and reusable code
- Integrate GUI or web interfaces for existing console applications
- Explore advanced Java libraries and frameworks for enhanced functionality
